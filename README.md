What is glu?
============
glu is a free/open source deployment and monitoring automation platform.

What problems does glu solve?
-----------------------------

glu is solving the following problems:

* deploy (and monitor) applications to an arbitrary large set of nodes: 

 * efficiently
 * with minimum/no human interaction
 * securely
 * in a reproducible manner

* ensure consistency over time (prevent *drifting*)
* detect and troubleshoot quickly when problems arise

How does it work?
-----------------

glu takes a very **declarative** approach, in which you describe/model what you want, and glu can then:

* compute the set of actions to deploy/upgrade your applications
* ensure that it remains consistent over time
* detect and alert you when there is a mismatch
